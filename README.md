# A Python scrapping tool
- It takes two inputs
    - Your desired website to scrape and the keyword that determines the returned website.
- It works with a set Data structure to ensure there's no repetition of a link already captured.
- It keeps track of active sites and only includes active sites
- After correctly inputting the right data, it returns a file "scrapped.txt" in the particular directory your Python code is. The file contains a list of your scrapped data, which is specifically a link for this project containing your **keyword**
